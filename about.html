                        <h4>My passion is to be a Fearless Role Model and Beauty Risk Taker!</h4>
                        <p>I started my Mary Kay business in March 1998 while on a &#34;long term&#34; hiatus
                            from my high pressure government job. For my husband John and I, it was important that
                            I stayed at home with my two sons, Seth and Shane. I realized the importance of
                            being the one to teach them how to read, which they did by the age of three.
                            Despite having the college diplomas on the wall, I knew that I was doing exactly what
                            I <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">loved</span> doing.</p>
                        <p>However, I also discovered that I wanted to be known as 	&#34;Adena	&#34; and not simply &#34;John&#39;s wife&#34;
                            or &#34;Seth and Shane&#39;s mom.&#34; When someone shared the Mary Kay opportunity with me, she felt that
                            this Career Opportunity would benefit not just me and my family, but the community as well.
                            I began my career in Charleston, South Carolina. The next year we relocated to
                            Georgia which was a new adventure for everyone to experience.  Seven moves in the next nine years
                            kept us all very busy, but I knew that my Mary Kay business was always a priority.</p>
                        <p>Having lived in Northwest Georgia for the past eleven years, my family and I are still close and
                            enjoy spending time together. My mother, Velva, now lives with us at Serendipity
                            in Adairsville, GA.</p>
                        <p>Come and experience my home as well as My Home Studio!
